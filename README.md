# R-packages

This is a small rails project that given a CRAN server (a server that hosts R-lang packages) will:
1. Read a list with all the packages in that server, and extract some information from each package
2. For each package, decompress it and read smore more information from the DESCRIPTION file.
3. Store that info in a DB
5. Show a simple list with all packages stored
6. Run a worker periodically to store new packages


# Dependencies

```
# These steps might be slightly different as I already had mysql/mariadb installed
brew install mysql
brew install redis
brew tap homebrew/services
brew services start mysql

gem install bundler
bundle install
```

# Running it

Before:

```
rails db:create
```

Run the server:
```
bundle exec rails s
# open localhost:3000, see the list
```

To run the cron:
```
bundle exec sidekiq
```

To populate the DB:
```
bundle exec rails c
NewPackagesWorker.new.perform(amount: 50, days: 365)
```

To test:
```
bundle exec rspec
```

# Other options/things

### Using has_many :through with users

It's quite obvious that instead of serializing the authors and maintainers we
could have a `Person` model, but this would involve checking if the user exists,
and two extra tables which don't add a lot of benefit in this example.

### Not using `package_helper`

I don't like a lot draper gem and I think a helper is fine enough for such an exercise.

### Mocking downloads instead of using VCR

For me it was quicker to use a simple mock than adding VCR

### Would be niceâ„¢ to download and read the package info in parallel
